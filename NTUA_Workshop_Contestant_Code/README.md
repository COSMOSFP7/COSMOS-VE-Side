# Platform-side

By platform side, we indicate services or components that are expected to be hosted/run within a centralized platform oriented solution
(e.g. IBM Bluemix) or other Cloud solution.

This side is typical of not having the constraints found in IoT devices and is able to scale, manage large quantities of data and perform
other time and resource demanding operations.

The existence of such services enables the Things side to offload part of their functionality and typically the majority (if not all) of
their data in an aggregated data management solution such as a database, Cloud object storage solution etc.
